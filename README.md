PVZ2PAK is the best mod of PVZ1 which restores PVZ2 by [JiangNanGame](http://www.jiangnangame.com) . We modify the files in PVZ1 including image, animate and program files to make it look like PVZ2. 

This Fork of PvZ2 Pak fixes issues most people have with the original PvZ2 Pak.

PVZ2PAK is free. We welcome everyone who follows [The Changjiang River License](https://github.com/jiangnangame/The-Changjiang-River-License) to improve it after we stop updating and maintaining it.

PVZ2PAK has [a small software](https://github.com/ATOMICFAZBEAR/PVZ2PAK-ChangerFixed) to change some images such as the clothes of plants in PVZ2PAK.

<p style="font-weight:bold;color:red">
We developed PVZ2PAK only for learning purposes. You must not use the program for commercial purposes, otherwise the legal issues should be resolved by yourself.
